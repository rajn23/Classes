<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<h3>OUR Shop</h3>
<h4><pre>A Fruit stand is a primarily open air business venue that sells seasonal fruit and many fruit products
     from local growers.It might also sell vegetables and various processed items derived from fruit.
    
    the fruit stand is an small business structure that is primarily run as an independent sole proprietorship,
    when very few franchies or branches or larger fruit stand conglomerates,through many large food industry
     businesses have developed from fruit stand business.
     
     The fruit stand has been a neighborhood hub for many generations and is one of the few enterprises that is
     important to every culture and readily available on every continent.
    
    fruit stands still comprise a primary distribution system for the fresh produce consumed by millions in 
    developing countries.</pre>
